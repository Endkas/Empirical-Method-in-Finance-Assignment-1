# Empirical-Method-in-Finance-Assignment-1
This report aims to analyze the stock performance of the S&P500 indexâ€™s constituents. We will first briefly explain what the S&P500 stock market index is, and how its con- stituents enter and leave the index. Then, we will analyze the skewness and kurtosis of the individual companies to get a better idea of their distribution characteristics. Next, we will conduct various hypothesis tests. starting with the Jarque & Bera test and the Kolmogorov & Smirnov test to check for normality of distribution followed by the Ljung Box test to check for potential auto-correlations. Finally, we will run a regression on each individual stock, with the return on the market portfolio as the independent variable. Finally, we will briefly explain the significance of these empirical results in the context of investment strategies.

Our data set includes the prices of 452 out of the 500 constituents of the S&P500 index, as well as the value of the index itself, over an unspecified period of time, indexed at 100 in time 0. The data processing and analysis was conducted with Python, using various li- braries.
